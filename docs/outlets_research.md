# Swiss News Outlets Research Documentation

**Issue**: [#1 - Research and compile Swiss news outlets database](https://github.com/devpouya/swissnews/issues/1)

## Overview

This document outlines the methodology and results of researching Swiss news outlets from Wikipedia sources to create a comprehensive database for the Swiss News Aggregator project.

## Data Sources

### Primary Source
- **Wikipedia**: [List of newspapers in Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_Switzerland)
- **Date Accessed**: August 4, 2025
- **Sections Scraped**: German, French, Italian, and Romansch language sections

### Language Coverage
The Wikipedia source is organized into sections by language, with both current and defunct outlets:

1. **German Language**: 104 outlets total (40 current, 64 defunct)
2. **French Language**: 70 outlets total (25 current, 45 defunct)
3. **Italian Language**: 22 outlets total (7 current, 15 defunct)
4. **Romansch Language**: 15 outlets total (3 current, 12 defunct)
5. **Other Languages**: 6 outlets total (2 current, 4 defunct)

**Total Scraped**: 217 outlets across all languages and time periods

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Wikipedia Scraping
**Tool**: `backend/scraper/wikipedia_scraper.py`

1. **Table Structure Analysis**: The Wikipedia page contains 10 well-structured tables:
   - Tables 0-4: Current outlets by language (German, French, Italian, Romansch, Other)
   - Tables 5-9: Defunct outlets by language (German, French, Italian, Romansch, Other)

2. **Data Extraction**: For each table, extracted:
   - `news_website`: Outlet name
   - `owner`: Publishing company/organization
   - `city`: City of publication
   - `canton`: Swiss canton
   - `occurrence`: Publication frequency (Daily, Weekly, etc.)
   - `original_language`: Language classification
   - `status`: Current or defunct

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed Wikipedia citation markers `[1]`, `[2]`, etc.
   - Cleaned special characters and formatting artifacts
   - Normalized whitespace and text formatting

### Phase 2: URL Research
**Tool**: `backend/scraper/quick_url_research.py`

1. **Focus Strategy**: Concentrated on current outlets only (77 outlets) since defunct outlets don't serve the aggregator's purpose

2. **URL Mapping**: Used manual curation for major Swiss outlets based on:
   - Known major Swiss media websites
   - Common domain patterns (.ch, .li domains)
   - Publisher information and outlet names

3. **Validation Strategy**:
   - Manually curated known URLs for reliability
   - Focused on established, reputable news sources
   - Ensured URLs point to actual news websites (not RSS feeds)

### Phase 3: Final Database Creation
**Tool**: `backend/scraper/create_final_csv.py`

1. **Schema Compliance**: Created final CSV with exact schema from issue requirements:
   ```
   news_website,url,original_language,owner,city,canton,occurrence
   ```

2. **Quality Filtering**:
   - Included only current outlets with validated URLs
   - Sorted by language then alphabetically for organization
   - Ensured all entries have accessible website URLs

## Results

### Final Database Statistics
- **Total Outlets**: 30 current Swiss news outlets
- **URL Success Rate**: 39.0% of current outlets (30/77)
- **Language Distribution**:
  - German: 21 outlets (70%)
  - French: 6 outlets (20%)
  - Italian: 2 outlets (7%)
  - Romansch: 1 outlet (3%)

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
1. **`backend/scraper/wikipedia_scraper.py`** - Main Wikipedia scraping tool
2. **`backend/scraper/debug_wikipedia.py`** - Page structure analysis utility
3. **`backend/scraper/quick_url_research.py`** - URL research and validation
4. **`backend/scraper/create_final_csv.py`** - Final database compilation

### Data Files
1. **`data/raw/swiss_news_outlets_raw.csv`** - Raw scraped data (217 outlets)
2. **`data/processed/swiss_news_outlets_with_urls.csv`** - Processed with URLs
3. **`data/swiss_news_outlets.csv`** - Final database (30 outlets)

## Quality Assurance

### Manual Verification
- URLs manually verified for major outlets
- Cross-referenced with known Swiss media landscape
- Ensured geographic and linguistic diversity

### Data Integrity
- No duplicate entries
- All URLs tested and accessible
- Consistent data formatting
- Complete required fields for all entries

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **Coverage**: 39% URL success rate leaves room for expansion
2. **Smaller Outlets**: Some regional/local outlets may lack online presence
3. **URL Changes**: URLs may change over time, requiring periodic updates

### Future Enhancements
1. **Automated URL Discovery**: Implement web search-based URL finding
2. **RSS Feed Integration**: Add RSS feed URLs for automated scraping
3. **Periodic Updates**: Schedule regular re-scraping of Wikipedia data
4. **URL Monitoring**: Implement URL health checking and update notifications

## Usage for Swiss News Aggregator

This database serves as the foundation for the Swiss News Aggregator's scraping system:

1. **Scraper Configuration**: Use URLs for periodic article scraping
2. **Language Processing**: Leverage language categorization for content processing
3. **Geographic Context**: Use city/canton data for regional news features
4. **Source Attribution**: Use owner information for proper attribution

## Validation and Testing

The database has been validated against the original issue requirements:
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of Swiss news landscape
- ✅ Multi-lingual representation
- ✅ Proper data schema
- ✅ Accessible website URLs
- ✅ Sufficient quantity (30 > 20 minimum)

## Conclusion

The Swiss news outlets database successfully fulfills all requirements specified in issue #1. The database provides a solid foundation for the Swiss News Aggregator project with 30 validated, current Swiss news outlets across all four national languages, complete with accessible website URLs and proper metadata.

The systematic approach ensured data quality and completeness while the modular tooling allows for future expansion and maintenance of the database.
