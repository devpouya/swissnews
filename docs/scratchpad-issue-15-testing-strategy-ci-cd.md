**Issue Link**: https://github.com/devpouya/swissnews/issues/15

## Understanding the Problem

Issue #15 requires implementing a comprehensive testing strategy and CI/CD pipeline for the Swiss News Aggregator project. This addresses the updated spec.md requirements for robust testing coverage and automated quality assurance.

### Requirements Analysis
- Design comprehensive test strategy covering all critical paths
- Add end-to-end tests for full user workflows
- Create CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Achieve >80% test coverage for core business logic
- Add performance tests, API contract tests
- Prevent broken code from merging

### Current State Analysis
✅ **Existing**:
- Unit tests for Wikipedia scraper (`tests/unit/test_wikipedia_scraper.py`)
- Integration tests for database schema (`tests/integration/test_database_schema.py`)
- Basic pytest setup in Makefile (`make test`)
- Backend requirements.txt with core dependencies

❌ **Missing**:
- No CI/CD pipeline (no `.github/workflows/`)
- No end-to-end tests
- No frontend testing framework
- No test coverage reporting
- No pytest configuration
- No code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- No API contract tests
- No performance tests

## Technical Approach

### 1. Testing Infrastructure Setup

**Backend Testing Enhancement**:
- Add `pytest.ini` configuration
- Add `pytest-cov` for coverage reporting
- Add `pytest-mock` for enhanced mocking
- Add `pytest-asyncio` for async test support
- Configure test database isolation

**Frontend Testing Setup**:
- Add Jest + React Testing Library to `package.json`
- Configure Vitest as modern alternative
- Add TypeScript testing support
- Add component testing utilities

**Test Organization**:
```
tests/
├── unit/           # Unit tests for individual components
├── integration/    # Integration tests for system components
├── e2e/           # End-to-end tests
├── api/           # API contract tests
├── performance/   # Performance and load tests
└── fixtures/      # Test data and utilities
```

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

**GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
- **Trigger**: PRs, pushes to main
- **Backend Pipeline**:
  - Python version matrix (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
  - Install dependencies
  - Run linting (flake8, black)
  - Run type checking (mypy)
  - Run unit and integration tests
  - Generate coverage reports
  - Upload coverage to Codecov

- **Frontend Pipeline**:
  - Node.js version matrix (18, 20)
  - Install dependencies
  - Run linting (ESLint)
  - Run type checking (TypeScript)
  - Run unit tests
  - Build application

- **Database Testing**:
  - PostgreSQL service container
  - Run database migrations
  - Test schema validation

- **End-to-End Testing**:
  - Start full application stack
  - Run E2E tests with Playwright
  - Generate test reports

### 3. End-to-End Testing Strategy

**E2E Test Scenarios**:
1. **Complete Scraping Workflow**:
   - Trigger scraper
   - Verify articles stored in database
   - Check vector embeddings generated

2. **Article Similarity Search**:
   - Navigate to article page
   - Verify similar articles displayed
   - Test similarity relevance

3. **Multilingual Article Serving**:
   - Switch language
   - Verify native language preference
   - Test translation fallback

4. **Frontend User Journey**:
   - Homepage article display
   - Article navigation
   - Language switching
   - Responsive design

**Tool Selection**: Playwright (better than Cypress for multi-language, cross-browser testing)

### 4. Enhanced Test Coverage

**Missing Unit Tests**:
- Database connection utilities
- CSV population scripts
- Configuration management
- Error handling utilities

**API Contract Tests**:
- Article endpoints (when implemented)
- Search functionality
- Multilingual content serving
- Error response formats

**Performance Tests**:
- Database query performance
- Vector similarity search speed
- Frontend loading times
- Scraping efficiency

## Implementation Plan

## Technical Considerations

### Testing Database Isolation
- Use separate test database
- Reset database state between tests
- Use database transactions for isolation
- Mock external services appropriately

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Test on multiple Python versions
- Test on different Node.js versions
- Ensure consistent behavior across environments
- Handle platform-specific dependencies

### Performance Optimization
- Parallel test execution
- Efficient Docker layer caching
- Smart test selection (only run affected tests)
- Optimize CI pipeline execution time

### Security Considerations
- Secure handling of test credentials
- No secrets in test code
- Proper test data sanitization
- Secure CI/CD environment configuration
